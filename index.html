    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy<u> text </u>of the printing and typesetting industry. <br><br>

       <b><i> Lorem Ipsum </b>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the<mark> 1500s, </mark>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br><br> </i>

        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the<mark> 1960s </mark>with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br>Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like><strong><s> Aldus PageMaker </s></strong>including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
